# Vortex Paint Mixer

This is my OpenSource vortex paint mixer.

You can also find it on thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3605287

The reason why i created this, is i wanted to have an easy way to shake my paints. I used an adapter on a jig saw, which worked pretty well but was verry noisy to.

I stumpled over the vortex mixer from NDubiel on thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:534894 which was quite good but i wanted to improve some stuff.

Look the video how it works

## Software used to create this project

* For 3d modelling: [http://openscad.org](http://openscad.org)
* For the pcb: [http://http://kicad.org/](http://kicad.org/)

I thank all the people which make it possible to create a project like this with there free software.

## Scad files

The case / lid and motorclamp scad file is the [scadfiles/case.scad](scadfiles/case.scad)

The top scad file is the [scadfiles/top.scad](scadfiles/top.scad)

## Howto build the mixer

### Tools

  * A 3d printer or use one of the services which print the objects for you
  * Soldering iron
  * Superglue
  * Hotglue gun
  * Optional if you want to create the pcb a mill or edging equipment

### Motorcontroller PCB Components

  * 1 x Diode (for example a 4007)
  * 1 x Poti 10K
  * 2 x Capacitor 47uF at 20V or greater 
  * 1 x LM317
  * 1 x Heatsink for the LM317 **required** 
  * 1 x 1k Resistor
  * 2 x Screw Terminal (Optional) 

### Other electronic Components

  * 12V DC Motor
  * Micro Switch
  * 1 x Powerplug (Optional) 
  * Poti Knob
  * 12 to 20 volt power supply

### General Components

  * 4 x Rubber Foot 
  * 1 x M3 * 30 Bolt + 3M Nut for the motor clamp
  * 5 x M3 tapping screws
  * Bearing for the cuppler
  * For the top 4M x 20 Bolt and 2 4M x Nuts

### Components to print

#### For the Mixer Case:

Print the following parts. Each one time.

I used 20% infill and PLA.

* [stls/case_bottom.stl](stls/case_bottom.stl)
* [stls/motor_clamp.stl](stls/motor_clamp.stl)
* [stls/wedge.stl](stls/wedge.stl)
* [stls/lid.stl](stls/lid.stl)
* [stls/coupler.stl](stls/coupler.stl)

#### For the paint bottle tops

Select the one which yo need.

I used 20% infill and PLA.

* [Vallejo](stls/tops/vallejo_top.stl)
* [Vallejo big bottle](stls/tops/vallejo_big_top.stl)
* [Games Workshop](stls/tops/games_workshop_top.stl)
* [Games Workshop old](stls/tops/games_workshop_old_top.stl)

## Motorcontroller PCB

The schemantics is like this

![PCB schemantic](assets/schemantic.png)

You can either use the pcb which i generated with KICAD. The project files are located in the folder: **[pcb](pcb)**

If you don't have the possibility to create the pcb you can also freewire the electronics.

## Build Instructions

### Mixer

Hot glue the micro switch into the case and wire the switch to the power plug.

![case_bottom_2.jpg](assets/build_images/case_bottom_2.jpg)

![case_bottom_3.jpg](assets/build_images/case_bottom_3.jpg)

Put the motorclamp and the motor together

![motorclamp_2.jpg](assets/build_images/motorclamp_2.jpg)
![motorclamp_3.jpg](assets/build_images/motorclamp_3.jpg)

Assemble the pcb. Don't forget the heatsink :)

![pcb.jpg](assets/build_images/pcb.jpg)

Wire the wires to the pcb from the powerplug, micro switch and the motor.

![motor_wired.jpg](assets/build_images/motor_wired.jpg)

Fix the poti with the nut onto the case.

![poti_fixed.jpg](assets/build_images/poti_fixed.jpg)

Add the knob to the poti.

![poti_knob.jpg](assets/build_images/poti_knob.jpg)

Add the wedge to the motor clamp. Mine broke a little bit when i tokked of the printer. But it is still working. 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

![wedge.jpg](assets/build_images/wedge.jpg)


![motorclamp_and_wedge.jpg](assets/build_images/motorclamp_and_wedge.jpg)

Screw the motorclamp into the case.

![motor_screwed_into_case.jpg](assets/build_images/motor_screwed_into_case.jpg)

Screw the lid onto the case.

![lid_closed.jpg](assets/build_images/lid_closed.jpg)

Superglue the bearing into the coupler.

![coupler.jpg](assets/build_images/coupler.jpg)

Put the coupler onto the motor.

## Paint bottle top

Here is a picture of the diffrent tops and the corresponding paint bottles.

![tops_and_bottles.jpg](assets/build_images/tops_and_bottles.jpg)

Put a M4 nut into the bottom of the top.

![top_1.jpg](assets/build_images/top_1.jpg)

Screw a M4 bolt from the other side into the top and put a second M4 nut at the bottom. 

![top_2.jpg](assets/build_images/top_2.jpg)


**DONE ! :)**

![complete.jpg](assets/build_images/complete.jpg)

Just plugin the power and push down the color top into the coupler.
